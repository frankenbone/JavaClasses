The input number is less than the midVal for each call to findNumber(), so the recursive case is reached, " b" is printed, and the lower half is searched from lowVal to midVal.
 
When number equals midVal, the base case is reached and " a" is printed.

Recursive method call outputs:
findNumber(0, 0, 12) prints: 0 6 b
findNumber(0, 0, 6) prints: 0 3 b
findNumber(0, 0, 3) prints: 0 1 b
findNumber(0, 0, 1) prints: 0 0 a
Yours	b	Expected	
0 6 b
0 3 b
0 1 b
0 0 a
